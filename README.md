## About
ðŸ‘‹ G'day, Iâ€™m Jordan Chappell, a software developer from Newcastle, Australia.

### Professional
I work for an amazing local company called Cordel as a full stack developer,
in the .NET stack with some JavaScript (plus React) on the side.
We specialise in providing LIDAR based solutions to asset management
and infringement detection problems with products in the Rail and UAV
spaces.

### Academic
I studied Computer Science and hold a Bachelor's degree obtained at the 
University of Newcastle, where I also held my first job in the industry.

### Personal
A lot of my time is split between the lounge with my wife and cat, playing
games (video and tabletop) with friends, or skating around Newcastle.
I do also try to find the time to spend working on personal software projects,
having started a decent amount and finished a few. Currently I'm working on
setting up a small hobbyist music production setup, attempting to extract
some creativity from myself. ðŸŽ§ðŸŽ¶
