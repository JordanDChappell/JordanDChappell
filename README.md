## About
👋 G'day, I'm Jordan.

🌏 I live on the east coast of Australia in a beautiful city called Newcastle.

💼 I am a software developer.

### Professional
I work for an amazing local company called Cordel as 'Lead Web Developer'.
We specialise in providing LIDAR based solutions to asset management
and gauging clearance problems with products in the Rail and UAV
spaces.

Our web stack is built with .NET and ReactJS and is deployed across AWS
and Azure to meet customer requirements.

### Academic
I studied Computer Science and hold a Bachelor's degree obtained at the 
University of Newcastle, where I also held my first job in the industry.

### Personal
A lot of my time is split between the lounge with my wife and cat, playing
games (video and tabletop) with friends, or skating around Newcastle.
I do also try to find the time to spend working on personal software projects,
having started a decent amount and finished a few. Currently I'm working on
setting up a small hobbyist music production setup, attempting to extract
some creativity from myself. 🎧🎶
